# Simple-SIC-Assembler

This is an application for the System programming.

The assembler works as follows it needs two main files which is the OPTAB (operations table) so that the assembler can code each instruction operation into hexadecimel code and the second one is the SRC (Source Code) which you want to Assemble.

The output consists of three file :

1- SYMTAB (Symbol table).
2- Listing file. 
3- Object file.

My code maybe very long as it's very basic and simple.
